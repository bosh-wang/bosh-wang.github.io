This repository contains Github Action that will automatically do
1. Unzip the file downloaded from Notion
2. Rename the root index file to `index.html`
3. Add favicon to all html files
4. Commit the unzipped files to current repository

In doing so, you can simply upload the Notion exported file to this repository and CI will do all the work to finish Github Page.
